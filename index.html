            All laws referring to the criminalization of ‚Äúdepictions of children‚Äù exist to blanket all media (film, images, digital videos, audio files, paintings, holographs, Mongolian baskets, etch-and-sketch recreations, caveman scribbles) that capture real crimes committed against live, actual children. This interpretation has been the standard for years.
            <br>
            Several rulings in the district court case <a href=‚Äúhttps://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/564/996/1407869/‚Äú>United States v. Handley</a> explicitly state that child pornography produced <em>with zero victims</em> is not obscene under both the Ferber and Miller tests, and cannot be constitutionally outlawed.
            <br>
            Obscenity laws, in addition to not typically being used for people enjoying things privately (as opposed to knowingly distributing porn to minors,) do not apply automatically, and require evaluation by a court. As of the writing of this page, such a thing has not occurred on the state level, and it is arguable that a theoretical case could be appealed and subsequently overruled by federal standards.
