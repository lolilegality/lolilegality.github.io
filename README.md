### why
The question is brought up very often in otaku-populated spheres, with the same points constantly being rehashed. Eventually, an irritating resource created or managed by;

- journalists and Wikipedians who are bad at their jobs,
- internet randoms who have little interest in the topic to begin with,
- and normalf`riends :)` spitting out kneejerk inaccuracies,

will be pointed to, prolonging the argument.

I bought a domain hack, so people can hopefully argue less and enjoy things more, filled with unprofessional, biased information I know that could eventually be filled with professional, balanced information others know. That is all.
